# CNC Plotter Machine

The Secure Communication with NRF24L01 Module and Arduino Nano project aims to establish a secure and encrypted communication channel between two devices using the NRF24L01 wireless module and Arduino Nano microcontrollers. This project ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the devices by implementing encryption algorithms and secure communication protocols.

This project is special than the rest of the other projects that I have done so far, as it contains an illustration of the circuit of the sender and the receiver i have made using Fritzing software, and a PCB drawing ready to print it using EasyEDA software. All of this you will find it in this [folder](https://oshwlab.com/ashrafabdulkhaliq80/security-project).

5. Upload the respective Arduino sketches to the Arduino Nano devices.
6. Power on the devices using the appropriate power supply.
7. Ensure that the devices establish a wireless connection by checking the status LEDs on the NRF24L01 modules.
8. Start sending and receiving encrypted data between the devices.

## Components

- 2 * Arduino Nano
- 2 * NRF24L01 Module
- 1 * LCD 2x16
- 1 * Buzzer
- 1 * 10K Potentiometer

## Usage

Once the Secure Communication system is set up and the devices are connected, you can use the following instructions to securely communicate between them:

- Ensure that both devices are powered on and within range of each other.
- The devices will automatically establish a wireless connection using the NRF24L01 modules.
- Use the provided functions in the Arduino sketches to encrypt and decrypt the data before sending and after receiving.
- Send the encrypted data from one device to the other using the established wireless connection.
- On the receiving device, decrypt the received data to retrieve the original message.
- Validate the authenticity of the received data using the implemented authentication mechanisms.

## Configuration

The Secure Communication project implements the following security measures:

- **Encryption Algorithms**: Utilize strong encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to encrypt the data transmitted between the devices.
- **Authentication Mechanisms**: Implement authentication mechanisms, such as digital signatures or shared secret keys, to verify the identity of the devices and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication Protocols**: Utilize secure communication protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security), to protect against data tampering and interception.
- **Key Management**: Employ secure key management practices, such as key exchange protocols or key rotation, to maintain the confidentiality of encryption keys.
